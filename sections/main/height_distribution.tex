\section{Height Distribution}
\label{sec: height distribution}

Let \((T,\rf_T,H_T)\sim\pp\) be a random critical point. As we have
already pointed out in Subsection~\ref{subsubsec: height distriubtion of minimas},
the height distribution of minima is of particular interest. But since it is
not more difficult to look at the height distributions of critical points with
index \(\alpha\), we are going to do this instead. Simply remember that the
case \(\alpha=0\) is especially dear to us.

Of course the height distribution is already a special case of the general
conditional mark distribution and we have
\[
	\Pr(\rf_T \in A \mid \negEV(H_T) = \alpha)
	\overset{\eqref{eq: index conditional distribution of marks}}=
	\frac{
		\E[|\det(H)|\ind_{\negEV(H)=\alpha}\ind_A(Z)]
	}{
		\E[|\det(H)|\ind_{\negEV(H)=\alpha}]
	}.
\]
As the denominator is just the normalization constant and a special case
of the enumerator anyway, we only need to consider the enumerator.
Both determinant and index \(\negEV\) become more simple when we
switch to the eigenvalues \(\evH_1,\dots,\evH_\dims\) of the random matrix
\(H\). Because we have
with some abuse of notation
\[
	\det(H) = \prod_{i=1}^\dims \evH_i
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	\negEV(H) = \negEV(\evH)
	= \frac1\dims \sum_{i=1}^\dims \ind_{\evH_i < 0}.
\]
This implies
\[\begin{aligned}
	\E[\ind_{A}(Z)\ind_{\negEV(H) = \alpha}|\det(H)|]
	&= \E[\ind_{A}(Z)
	\ind_{\negEV^{-1}(\alpha)}(\evH)\prod_{i=1}^\dims |\evH_i|]\\
	&= \int_A \underbrace{
		\E\Big[
			\ind_{\negEV(\evH) = \alpha}\prod_{i=1}^\dims |\evH_i|
			\Bigm| Z=z
		\Big]
		\varphi_Z(z)
	}_{=:c\Psi_\alpha(z)}
	dz,
\end{aligned}\]
where \(\varphi_Z(z)\) is the marginal density of \(Z=Z(0)\) and \(c\) is the
normalization constant in the denominator we discarded earlier.
The conditional distribution \(Z_T \mid \negEV(H_T) = \alpha\) is therefore
absolutely continuous with density \(\Psi_\alpha\).

Recall that we derived the conditional distribution of the eigenvalues \(\evH\)
in Subsection~\ref{subsec: Lambda|rf}. And it were simply GOE eigenvalues with
an independent shift. So the conditional height distribution is up to
a constant
\[\begin{aligned}
	\Psi_\alpha(z)
	\overset{\eqref{eq: expectation f(Lambda) | Z}}&\sim
	\E\Bigg[
		\ind\Bigl\{
			\negEV\left(\evGOE \dotPlus \epsilon + \tfrac{\sqC'(0)}{\sqC(0)}z\right) = \alpha
		\Bigr\}
		\prod_{i=1}^\dims \left|
			\evGOE_i  + \epsilon + \tfrac{\sqC'(0)}{\sqC(0)}z
		\right|
	\Bigg]
	\varphi_\rf(z)\\
	&= \int \E\Bigg[
		\ind\Bigl\{
			\negEV\left(\evGOE \dotPlus t + \tfrac{\sqC'(0)}{\sqC(0)}z\right) = \alpha
		\Bigr\}
		\prod_{i=1}^\dims \left|
			\evGOE_i  + t + \tfrac{\sqC'(0)}{\sqC(0)}z
		\right|
	\Bigg]
	\varphi_\epsilon(t)dt
	\varphi_\rf(z),
\end{aligned}\]
where \(\varphi_\epsilon\) is the density of \(\normal\bigl(0,
\sqC''(0)-\frac{\sqC'(0)^2}{\sqC(0)}\bigr)\).

The interesting bit is
\[
	f_\dims(x):=\E\Bigg[
		\ind\Bigl\{
			\negEV\left(\evGOE \dotMinus x\right) = \alpha
		\Bigr\}
		\prod_{i=1}^\dims \left|
			\evGOE_i - x
		\right|
	\Bigg]
\]
using this abstraction we simply have
\[\begin{aligned}
	\Psi(z)
	&\sim \varphi_\rf(z)
	\int f_\dims\bigl(\tfrac{-\sqC'(0)}{\sqC(0)}z - t\bigr)
	\varphi_\epsilon(t)dt\\
	&= \varphi_\rf(z)
	(f_\dims * \varphi_\epsilon)\bigl(\tfrac{-\sqC'(0)}{\sqC(0)}z\bigr),
\end{aligned}\]
where \(f*g\) denotes the convolution of \(f\) and \(g\).

Let us now take a closer look at \(f_\dims\). 
By definition we have
\[
		\ind\Bigl\{
			\negEV\left(\evGOE \dotMinus x\right) = \alpha
		\Bigr\}
		= \ind\Bigl\{
			\frac1\dims\sum_{i=1}^\dims \ind_{\evGOE_i < x} = \alpha
		\Bigr\}
\]
So using the density of the
eigenvalues of the GOE \eqref{eq: GOE ev density} and \(a:=2\sqC''(0)\),
we can expand \(f_\dims\) to
\[
	f_\dims(x)
	= c^\evGOE_{\dims,a}\int
	\ind\Bigl\{
			\frac1\dims\sum_{i=1}^\dims \ind_{x_i < x} = \alpha
	\Bigr\}
	\underbrace{
	\prod_{i=1}^\dims \left|
		x_i - x
	\right|
	}_{=:(*)}
	e^{-\tfrac1{2a}\sum_{k=1}^\dims x_k^2} \Delta_N dx_1\dots dx_\dims
\]
where \(\Delta_\dims = \prod_{i<j}|x_i-x_j|\) is the Vandermonde
Determinant. Using the observation
\[
	\Delta_{\dims+1} = 
	\Delta_\dims\prod_{i=1}^\dims \left|
		x_i - x_{\dims+1}
	\right|,
\]
\textcite{fyodorovComplexityRandomEnergy2004} defined \(x_{\dims+1}:=x\) to
incorporate the determinant \((*)\) into the density of the GOE of dimension
\(\dims+1\). With a correction of the exponential and constant this
clever trick results in
\[\begin{aligned}
	&f_\dims(x_{\dims+1})\\
	&= \tfrac{c^\evGOE_{\dims, a}}{c^\evGOE_{\dims+1,a}}
	e^{\tfrac{x_{\dims+1}^2}{2a}}
	\int \ind\Bigl\{
			\frac1\dims\sum_{i=1}^\dims \ind_{x_i < x_{\dims+1}} = \alpha
	\Bigr\}
	\varphi^\evGOE_{\dims+1,a}(x_1,\dots,x_{\dims+1})
	dx_1\dots d_{x_\dims},
\end{aligned}\]
where \(\varphi^\evGOE_{\dims+1,a}\) is the eigenvalue density of the GOE
in \(\dims+1\) dimensions. At this point
\textcite{fyodorovComplexityRandomEnergy2004} was done, but we still have an
indicator left over. For this indicator to be one, exactly \(\dims\alpha\)
of the \(x_i\) need to be smaller \(x_{\dims+1}\). For the ordering
\(x_{(1)}\le\dots\le x_{(\dims+1)}\), we therefore have
\[
	\ind\Bigl\{
			\frac1\dims\sum_{i=1}^\dims \ind_{x_i < x_{\dims+1}} = \alpha
	\Bigr\}
	= \ind\{x_{(\dims\alpha+1)} = x_{\dims+1}\}.
\]
It is now helpful to calculate the density of \(\evGOE_{(k)}\) for an ordering
\(\evGOE_{(1)}\le\dots\le\evGOE_{(m)}\) of the GOE eigenvalues of \(m\)
dimensions. Since \(\evGOE_1,\dots,\evGOE_m\) are exchangeable random
variables, we get
\[\begin{aligned}
	\Pr(\evGOE_{(k)}\in A)
	&= \int \varphi^\evGOE_{m,a}(x_1,\dots,x_m) \ind_{x_{(k)}\in A}dx_1\dots dx_m\\
	&= \int \varphi^\evGOE_{m,a}(x_1,\dots,x_m) \ind_{x_{(k)}\in A}
	\sum_{i=1}^m \ind_{x_{(k)}=x_i} dx_1\dots dx_m\\
	&= \sum_{i=1}^m \int \varphi^\evGOE_{m,a}(x_1,\dots,x_m) \ind_{x_i\in A}
	\ind_{x_{(k)}=x_i} dx_1\dots dx_m\\
	\overset{\text{exchangeable}}&= m \int \varphi^\evGOE_{m,a}(x_1,\dots,x_m)
	\ind_{x_m\in A} \ind_{x_{(k)}=x_m} dx_1\dots dx_m\\
	&= \int_A \underbrace{m\left(\int \varphi^\evGOE_{m,a}(x_1,\dots,x_m)
	\ind_{x_{(k)}=x_m} dx_1\dots dx_{m-1}\right)}_{
		= \varphi_{\evGOE_{(k)}}(x_m)
	} dx_m.
\end{aligned}\]
If we take \(m=\dims+1\), \(k=\dims\alpha+1\) and re-substitute
\(x=x_{\dims+1}\) we can put the last three equations together to finally
get
\[
	f_\dims(x)
	= \tfrac{c^\evGOE_{\dims, a}}{c^\evGOE_{\dims+1,a}}
	\exp\bigl(\tfrac{x^2}{2a}\bigr)
	\frac1{\dims+1}\varphi_{\evGOE_{(\dims\alpha+1)}}(x).
